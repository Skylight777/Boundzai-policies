Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 17, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have when using our iOS app.

1. What Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information from users except for email addresses, which are provided voluntarily during account creation or login.
All other data ‚Äî such as notes, settings, and any personal content ‚Äî is stored locally on your device. We do not upload or store this data on external servers or cloud storage. Only you have access to this data.

2. Local Storage & Data Deletion
   
All user-generated data is saved only on your device.
We do not have access to your private information, and no data is transmitted to the cloud or to our servers.
When you delete the app, all user data is permanently deleted along with it.
This ensures maximum privacy and full control over your personal information.

3. Use of Email
   
We collect your email address for the purpose of user authentication.
This means your email is required to log in to the app, and we always have access to your email address stored securely on our side.
However, we do not have any access to your email content, inbox, messages, or any other information related to your email account.
With your explicit consent, your email address may also be used for:
sending newsletters or updates about the app;
sharing product news, offers, and relevant content.
You may opt out of marketing emails at any time by clicking the ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù link in the message or by contacting us directly.

4. Security

We take user privacy and data security seriously.
Because we do not store your personal data outside your device (with the exception of your email for authentication), you retain complete control over your information.
We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to third parties.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
   
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be posted in the app or on our official website, and we will notify users where appropriate.
